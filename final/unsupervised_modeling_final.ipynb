We investigated our grand pile of loot and we found documents in regards to one of the most infamous events in the history of the United States. The key is that the documents were not public, nor would this company want them public. Not to mention thousands of documents surrounding companies such as Monsanto, Bank of America, and many other Fortune 500...”\\n\\n#Some Documents \\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/1d319c019efc0a2d71e518329481b032-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/ac29bc3f47ce71191b2789f777a23297-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/df753ce9111fcde67dea986403c127eb-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/99b91cd19e7490d7772b01a7ac272ee9-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/ed92d235c94b2b06a10a0a65013c0cb6-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/1edf63b4f4cc9f2c7fbad89625f5757b-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/dedacabd7dea45a8910569677e8135b6-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/48b2689ad6adc168951731207547ef8c-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/8d99746f5b2c7ec6f1b7ed4dbf0074d3-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/43b37e3a09cf880e5895379b060b9d09-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/b5425d0f13fdf1a60a0a8efc992be9fe-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/555fec6a26b6981b460079bd168a33a6-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/6dbe877122e82837bbeee831fc509537-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/92a63f76bb1b31d5c6e032e130b81870-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/89e1cc9055818f153fe928543fe315cd-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/697109e0c3816ae39d0a0ffdd7c23610-full.jpg\\n\\n\\n“...We're also releasing a small part of the larger archive of the 911 World Trade Center Litigation documents publicly. There's thousands of files included in the archive. Everyone can freely have a copy of the archive and we would encourage it. However, the archive is completely encrypted using a very strong AES encryption and very strong master keys that will prevent anyone from decrypting the veracrypt containers until we publicly release the keys for each layer. The archive is split between five layers. Layer 1 being the most modest, and Layer 5 containing the most heavy hitting and impactful documents, with Layer 2, Layer 3, and Layer 4 containing ever-increasingly scandalous materials. We encourage everyone to obtain a copy of all five archives. As time goes on, we may publicly release keys for each of these containers if our request...”\\n\\n\\n#Key for Layer 1 has been released. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“...It wasn't just Hiscox Syndicates Ltd that was put at risk, it was Lloyds of London as well as others. Another entity unnamed  is Lloyds of London. Hiscox Syndicates Ltd and Lloyds of London are some of the biggest insurers on the planet insuring everything from the smallest policies to some of the largest policies on the planet, and who even insured structures such as the World Trade Centers. At this point, the keen amongst you may finally be drawing conclusions at this point, but you'll still be astonished at what's to come. Keep reading. This also means that Silverstein Properties is involved, doesn't it? Now things are getting more interesting. Most of you readers will not be privy to the processes and methods utilised by Fortune 500s to litigate high-impact cases, but we are, and thankfully for us, we're going to let you in on this process. When major incidents like the WTC 911 incident happen, part of the litigation must involve SSI (Sensitive Security Information) and SCI (Special Compartment Information) from the likes of the FBI, CIA, TSA, FAA, DOD, and others being introduced into evidence, but of course this can't become public, for fear of compromising a nation's security, so they temporarily release these materials to the solicitor firms involved in the litigation with the strict demand they're destroyed after their use and that remain highly protected and confidential to only be used behind closed doors.

I’m very very new to investing. I only just set up a fidelity account. I decided to take out $1000 out of my savings so that I’d have some wiggle room, but still have plenty left in the back. I have a very limited knowledge of stocks, but it’s something I want to get into because I feel like I can make more money with it since I’m not working due to the fact that I’m a full time college student. What are some stocks that aren’t too volatile, but can still make me a decent amount of money?\n",

       "10665    $HIMX - a potential Short squeeze play. GME X'mas special! **$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**TLDR:**\\n\\n1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\\n\\nThe shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\\n\\n2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\\n\\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\\*.\\*\\n\\n4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\\n\\n5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n..and now for the fun bit:\\n\\n6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\\n\\nThe amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**\\n\\n7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \\~15% last couple of weeks.\\n\\nDisclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfwdymqkrby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31f7c8d5426e1d5f26506469e3c71de44a3054f4\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**What does $HIMX do? Products?**\\n\\nBefore we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\\n\\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:\\n\\n\\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\\n\\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1n5j99qmrby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c541fc1f64fc52149b5559894a07782dbd6a6a36\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\\n\\n\\- ***High end Timing Controller*** which improves power efficiency in displays\\n\\n\\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gf47v2mnrby71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3abeceb85f503e711594507a3d7f1bf876753ad\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\- ***Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays*** – with usage in ***AR/VR glasses***, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), ***Holographic Displays***, etc.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9wde7norby71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0407a077b19352f7ea1b90f06fd4e15bf6ef670d\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\- ***Other products*** in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnlwalyprby71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0baf9dadae4939dabfa212c9b1001ea47344c1d\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3nuqds2rrby71.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f936ff4beb84e7901c6ae5576e0049b69de487a\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Revenue by segment:**\\n\\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\~12.5%.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptftqd0srby71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45abd9d6107b6e79491b8775f81f5a0eacb6a219\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***\\n\\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ougzk8osrby71.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=589115891d1e2aa41d33ab147a5d1ccce7b58ef7\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Competitors and Market Shares:**\\n\\nIn the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\\n\\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b55k1yktrby71.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f7f1a3c4d75e3f529428835e802315127f35c9d\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:\\n\\n\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%\\n\\n\\- Smartphones: 10.4%\\n\\n\\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\\n\\n\\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**\\n\\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\\n\\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.\\n\\n$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\\n\\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\\n\\n***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.\\n\\nThis gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***\\n\\nThis allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qea2duvrby71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afa533ebd26875345eaf4c62fc263b263fd7e147\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**\\n\\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.\\n\\nIn addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\\n\\nOn top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.\\n\\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.\\n\\n***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\\n\\nHowever, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\\n\\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nSo yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\\*.\\*\\n\\nNow, that’s the background\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**SHORT SQUEEZE**\\n\\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.\\n\\nSo, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\\*\\*’\\*\\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\~11 days to cover.\\n\\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\\n\\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0i4pnqwrby71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c93f3de4dd8eb9c3788bd14993f62d51d2214651\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWith earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***\\n\\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r689rsjxrby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba222cfe0972ca651243195605b554e26f4d8ba\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\\n\\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***\\n\\nI understand the short-thesis – I really do.\\n\\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\\n\\n***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***\\n\\nI can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\\n\\n***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***\\n\\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\\n\\n***But now, its time for a reversal.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**\\n\\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS  as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).\\n\\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\\n\\nSo far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\\n\\nAn 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***\\n\\n***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***\\n\\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\\n\\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***\\n\\nCompany has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\\n\\nAll in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \\~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.\\n\\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**\\n\\nA common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\\n\\nBut, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.\\n\\nSo, 2 points worth noting:\\n\\n1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\\*\\*’\\*\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\\n2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\\n\\nAlso, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\\n\\n\\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\\n\\n\\- ***Capex*** \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\\n\\nIn other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**\\n\\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\\n\\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycrah2gzrby71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22fbdf056d2a59dae4f167ab2af4342d1155f6ea\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.\\n\\nMuch of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***\\n\\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**\\n\\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\\n\\nAlthough the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\n\\n***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Q3 Earnings**\\n\\nNow – let’s discuss the recent earnings\\n\\n***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\\n\\n***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)\\n\\n**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!\\n\\n***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\\n\\nThe charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iafp0w21sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f09a541b8919354aeb49d2d8d134fa89caa4b170\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCharts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahwxlw42sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c6a50f51cc7ed5113acb1e1646a677bc13d6d5e\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**\\n\\nPerformance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\\n\\n***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:\\n\\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\\n\\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)\\n\\n(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\\n\\nWorries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.\\n\\nBefore I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\\n\\n\\+\\n\\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\\n\\n\\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\\n\\n\\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\\n\\nThis Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\\n\\n***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***\\n\\n\\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\\n\\n\\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\\n\\n\\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\\n\\n\\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\\n\\nYes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***\\n\\nTo be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to  its customers anyway.\\n\\n“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 50%.\\n\\nHowever, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 47.6% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\\*.\\*\\n\\n***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\\n\\nThis level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\\n\\nMr. Lopez’s question is below:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bet6o463sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ae1b659f263b95c39d8baa62943b9e8d944ce87\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe answer to this question was pretty much that\\n\\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and\\n\\nb) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.\\n\\nManagement also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.\\n\\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohq8i754sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d248a679dccc3f7cdcc8652297c727bd8356c78\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Top line guidance by segment:**\\n\\n\\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\\n\\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***\\n\\nBy sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\\n\\n\\- ***Smartphones*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***\\n\\n\\- ***Tablet*** \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and\\n\\n\\- ***Automotive*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\\n\\nInterestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.\\n\\nAlso, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***\\n\\n***Lots to like here.***\\n\\n***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.\\n\\nCompany notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.\\n\\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fafsthl5sby71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1b593a646120e9a85282d0a7bf396dc938b5b23\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\\*,\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***\\n\\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*\\n\\nIn addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***\\n\\n$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***\\n\\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.\\n\\n***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\\*.\\*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**\\n\\nThe chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\\n\\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\\n\\nThe ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgpjwx26sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3143bcb1893e5c70decac03bad63633475a57b1b\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\\*!\\*\\n\\n***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\\n\\nWe haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\\n\\n***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***\\n\\n***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.\\n\\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\\n\\n**Let’s squeeze this one dry. GME X’mas special.**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\- Yield Fanatic\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Yield\\_Fanatic](https://twitter.com/Yield_Fanatic)\\n\\n[**www.yieldfanatic.com**](https://www.yieldfanatic.com)\n",

Not to mention thousands of documents surrounding companies such as Monsanto, Bank of America, and many other Fortune 500...”\\n\\n#Some Documents \\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/1d319c019efc0a2d71e518329481b032-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/ac29bc3f47ce71191b2789f777a23297-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/df753ce9111fcde67dea986403c127eb-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/99b91cd19e7490d7772b01a7ac272ee9-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/ed92d235c94b2b06a10a0a65013c0cb6-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/1edf63b4f4cc9f2c7fbad89625f5757b-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/dedacabd7dea45a8910569677e8135b6-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/48b2689ad6adc168951731207547ef8c-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/8d99746f5b2c7ec6f1b7ed4dbf0074d3-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/43b37e3a09cf880e5895379b060b9d09-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/b5425d0f13fdf1a60a0a8efc992be9fe-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/555fec6a26b6981b460079bd168a33a6-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/6dbe877122e82837bbeee831fc509537-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/92a63f76bb1b31d5c6e032e130b81870-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/89e1cc9055818f153fe928543fe315cd-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/697109e0c3816ae39d0a0ffdd7c23610-full.jpg\\n\\n\\n“...We're also releasing a small part of the larger archive of the 911 World Trade Center Litigation documents publicly. There's thousands of files included in the archive. Everyone can freely have a copy of the archive and we would encourage it. However, the archive is completely encrypted using a very strong AES encryption and very strong master keys that will prevent anyone from decrypting the veracrypt containers until we publicly release the keys for each layer. The archive is split between five layers. Layer 1 being the most modest, and Layer 5 containing the most heavy hitting and impactful documents, with Layer 2, Layer 3, and Layer 4 containing ever-increasingly scandalous materials. We encourage everyone to obtain a copy of all five archives. As time goes on, we may publicly release keys for each of these containers if our request...”\\n\\n\\n#Key for Layer 1 has been released. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“...It wasn't just Hiscox Syndicates Ltd that was put at risk, it was Lloyds of London as well as others. Another entity unnamed  is Lloyds of London. Hiscox Syndicates Ltd and Lloyds of London are some of the biggest insurers on the planet insuring everything from the smallest policies to some of the largest policies on the planet, and who even insured structures such as the World Trade Centers. At this point, the keen amongst you may finally be drawing conclusions at this point, but you'll still be astonished at what's to come. Keep reading. This also means that Silverstein Properties is involved, doesn't it? Now things are getting more interesting. Most of you readers will not be privy to the processes and methods utilised by Fortune 500s to litigate high-impact cases, but we are, and thankfully for us, we're going to let you in on this process. When major incidents like the WTC 911 incident happen, part of the litigation must involve SSI (Sensitive Security Information) and SCI (Special Compartment Information) from the likes of the FBI, CIA, TSA, FAA, DOD, and others being introduced into evidence, but of course this can't become public, for fear of compromising a nation's security, so they temporarily release these materials to the solicitor firms involved in the litigation with the strict demand they're destroyed after their use and that remain highly protected and confidential to only be used behind closed doors. We stumbled upon the juiciest secrets a government has to offer...”\\n\\n\\n\\nThings are about to get interesting r/wallstreetbets\\n\\n</td>\n",

There's thousands of files included in the archive. Everyone can freely have a copy of the archive and we would encourage it. However, the archive is completely encrypted using a very strong AES encryption and very strong master keys that will prevent anyone from decrypting the veracrypt containers until we publicly release the keys for each layer. The archive is split between five layers. Layer 1 being the most modest, and Layer 5 containing the most heavy hitting and impactful documents, with Layer 2, Layer 3, and Layer 4 containing ever-increasingly scandalous materials. We encourage everyone to obtain a copy of all five archives. As time goes on, we may publicly release keys for each of these containers if our request...”\\n\\n\\n#Key for Layer 1 has been released. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“...It wasn't just Hiscox Syndicates Ltd that was put at risk, it was Lloyds of London as well as others.

This also means that Silverstein Properties is involved, doesn't it? Now things are getting more interesting. Most of you readers will not be privy to the processes and methods utilised by Fortune 500s to litigate high-impact cases, but we are, and thankfully for us, we're going to let you in on this process. When major incidents like the WTC 911 incident happen, part of the litigation must involve SSI (Sensitive Security Information) and SCI (Special Compartment Information) from the likes of the FBI, CIA, TSA, FAA, DOD, and others being introduced into evidence, but of course this can't become public, for fear of compromising a nation's security, so they temporarily release these materials to the solicitor firms involved in the litigation with the strict demand they're destroyed after their use and that remain highly protected and confidential to only be used behind closed doors.

Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &amp;lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\\n\\nThe shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\\n\\n2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\\n\\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\\*.\\*\\n\\n4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\\n\\n5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n..and now for the fun bit:\\n\\n6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\\n\\nThe amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**\\n\\n7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \\~15% last couple of weeks.\\n\\nDisclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfwdymqkrby71.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=31f7c8d5426e1d5f26506469e3c71de44a3054f4\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**What does $HIMX do? Products?**\\n\\nBefore we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\\n\\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:\\n\\n\\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \\-&amp;gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\\n\\n\\- ***Small &amp;amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \\-&amp;gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1n5j99qmrby71.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c541fc1f64fc52149b5559894a07782dbd6a6a36\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\\n\\n\\- ***High end Timing Controller*** which improves power efficiency in displays\\n\\n\\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \\--&amp;gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud).

So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\\n\\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\\n\\n***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.\\n\\nThis gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***\\n\\nThis allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qea2duvrby71.png?width=461&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=afa533ebd26875345eaf4c62fc263b263fd7e147\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**\\n\\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.\\n\\nIn addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\\n\\nOn top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.\\n\\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.\\n\\n***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\\n\\nHowever, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\\n\\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nSo yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\\*.\\*\\n\\nNow, that’s the background\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**SHORT SQUEEZE**\\n\\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.\\n\\nSo, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\\*\\*’\\*\\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\~11 days to cover.\\n\\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &amp;gt;20% against float now.\\n\\nLack of stock availability means &amp;gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0i4pnqwrby71.png?width=402&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c93f3de4dd8eb9c3788bd14993f62d51d2214651\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWith earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***\\n\\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r689rsjxrby71.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7ba222cfe0972ca651243195605b554e26f4d8ba\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &amp;gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\\n\\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***\\n\\nI understand the short-thesis – I really do.\\n\\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\\n\\n***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***\\n\\nI can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\\n\\n***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***\\n\\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\\n\\n***But now, its time for a reversal.***\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**\\n\\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS  as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).\\n\\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\\n\\nSo far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\\n\\nAn 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***\\n\\n***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***\\n\\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\\n\\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***\\n\\nCompany has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\\n\\nAll in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \\~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.\\n\\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**\\n\\nA common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\\n\\nBut, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.\\n\\nSo, 2 points worth noting:\\n\\n1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;amp;D expenses -&amp;gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\\*\\*’\\*\\*. R&amp;amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\\n2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\\n\\nAlso, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\\n\\n\\- ***R&amp;amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\\n\\n\\- ***Capex*** \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\\n\\nIn other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**\\n\\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\\n\\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycrah2gzrby71.png?width=601&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=22fbdf056d2a59dae4f167ab2af4342d1155f6ea\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.\\n\\nMuch of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***\\n\\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**\\n\\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\\n\\nAlthough the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\n\\n***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Q3 Earnings**\\n\\nNow – let’s discuss the recent earnings\\n\\n***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\\n\\n***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)\\n\\n**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!\\n\\n***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\\n\\nThe charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iafp0w21sby71.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f09a541b8919354aeb49d2d8d134fa89caa4b170\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCharts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahwxlw42sby71.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2c6a50f51cc7ed5113acb1e1646a677bc13d6d5e\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**\\n\\nPerformance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\\n\\n***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:\\n\\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\\n\\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)\\n\\n(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\\n\\nWorries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.\\n\\nBefore I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\\n\\n\\+\\n\\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\\n\\n\\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\\n\\n\\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\\n\\nThis Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\\n\\n***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***\\n\\n\\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\\n\\n\\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\\n\\n\\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\\n\\n\\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\\n\\nYes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***\\n\\nTo be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to  its customers anyway.\\n\\n“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&amp;gt; the gross margin would be 50%.\\n\\nHowever, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 47.6% -&amp;gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\\*.\\*\\n\\n***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\\n\\nThis level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\\n\\nMr. Lopez’s question is below:\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bet6o463sby71.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6ae1b659f263b95c39d8baa62943b9e8d944ce87\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe answer to this question was pretty much that\\n\\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and\\n\\nb) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.\\n\\nManagement also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.\\n\\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohq8i754sby71.png?width=602&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3d248a679dccc3f7cdcc8652297c727bd8356c78\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Top line guidance by segment:**\\n\\n\\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\\n\\n\\- ***Small &amp;amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&amp;gt;50% yoy***\\n\\nBy sub-segment within small &amp;amp; mid-sized DDIC:\\n\\n\\- ***Smartphones*** \\-&amp;gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp;amp; ***&amp;gt;30% yoy***\\n\\n\\- ***Tablet*** \\-&amp;gt; flat q-o-q, and\\n\\n\\- ***Automotive*** \\-&amp;gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&amp;gt;100% yoy***.

This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp;amp; IoT applications.***\\n\\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*\\n\\nIn addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***\\n\\n$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”.

       "      <td>himx a potential short squeeze play gme x mas special himx represents a very interesting opportunity at present x200b tldr taiwan based display driver chip ddic company – trading in us markets trades very cheapy at 2x sales 3x ebitda and 5x fcf all fy21e figures the shares are cheap in a more “normal” s p multiple environment let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential market maker mm manipulation direct valuation vs peers shows at least upside on traded comparables fv of between share vs today potential for up to upside share if the magnachip acquisition ev ebitda multiple becomes a precedent excellent q3 earnings much better than expected guidance for q4’and even q1’offering excellent visibility management is very credible and have consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last quarters mostly at higher end of guidance if not a beat altogether on track to pay between in dividends next year – representing a yield of between on current stock price of could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback not only are management very credible but they are also very competent having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers even before covid and having invested in both r d and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less x200b and now for the fun bit potential for a significant short squeeze short interest spiked all the way through to q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook as of october there were 7m shares short which against a 132m float equates to short against float nasdaq notes days to cover as of october the amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings which was last week on 4th november this means that it is highly likely that as of today more than of himx stock is now being shorted i believe this is now at the limit of shorting in other words there is very little available to short – and i have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore a big short squeeze is coming this is a “ gme x’mas special ” cannot confirm this unconfirmed hearsay but hearing that much of the short position is held by an asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up… and it has already shot up last couple of weeks disclosure i own stock jan’and mar’calls position screenshot below for transparency purposes i have exposure to shares shares option contracts across jan’and mar’x200b x200b x200b what does himx do products before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here is a quick snippet of what himax does himx is a fabless integrated chip ic design house specializing in the field of display driver ddics these ddics are used to make ‘panels’ which are in turn used in large sized ddics tvs notebooks monitors etc small mid sized ddics smartphones tablets displays in automotive vehicles etc x200b x200b x200b in addition to ddics himx also has a non ddic business which includes the following high end timing controller which improves power efficiency in displays wiseeye ultra power ai an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ai and ml to analyse collected data all within the chip itself rather than relying on transmission to cloud usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader internet of things iot area x200b x200b x200b liquid cystal on silicon lcos microdisplays – with usage in ar vr glasses automotive head up displays hud holographic displays etc x200b x200b x200b other products in wafer level optics wlo and 3d sensing facial recognition technology in phones etc x200b x200b x200b as a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are and where it is used x200b x200b x200b revenue by segment revenue is split broadly equally amongst large sized ddic smartphone and android tablets divisions all at roughly each – with automotive oem representing of revenue on aa last twelve month ltm basis and non driver ics x200b x200b x200b x200b however himx has seen significant growth in automotive oems and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward the q3 revenue split by segment is shown below x200b x200b x200b x200b competitors and market shares in the q3’presentation available here himx notes that it is the 4th largest ddic player globally with market share behind novatek samsung also a customer and lx semicon siliconworks you may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here which have smaller ddic contributions by revenue including focaltech synaptics sitronix and mediatek x200b x200b x200b x200b as for market share by the individual segments as of q3’himx’s market shares were large ddic smartphones tablets but note that himx has market share of android non ios tablets – the quoted here is across all tablets including apple automotive oem x200b so what has been happening recently with himax was an excellent year for himx not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors company realized quite early on even before covid that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products himx management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes” would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity so over the last few years himx cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long term contracts to secure additional supply for itself when covid hit in early and when all corporates cancelled their product orders extra foundry capacity came to market initially… and himx capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves covid was a blessing in disguise for himx – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals but the significant increase in demand for its end products meant that himx found itself in a very sweet spot this gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked when many ddic providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply especially the non taiwanese players himx walked out in a full jump suit and that too a colourful one this allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year the graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the smartphone and tablets segments especially in fy20 x200b x200b x200b x200b so what is this increase in demand that management foresaw himx management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products consumer electronics broadly speaking … but also saw the increasing adoption of hq screens in new areas like internet of things iot and automotive vehicles in addition the modernisation and electrification of vehicles ev would further boost the requirement for screens at the same time and slightly unrelated but worth mentioning now they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly this resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the non driver ic business which in itself has a lot of growth potential in other words the business invested in potential diversification away from just ddics into related products on top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products screen adoption in other areas electrification of vehicles etc management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5g and high performance computing hpc – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its ddic business used in other words himx management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for some time ago i guess what this shows is that management here are excellent x200b x200b is not adding long term supply at a time when demand spiked risky will demand persist as mentioned earlier himx added market share in and – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients however himx was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i e the consumer electronics automotive oem brands in other words the increase in supply that himx is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand… and himx is just in between satisfying that demand himx has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from himx for the foreseeable future so yes for now – the demand will persist and as management has said this demand will persist into much of given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and himx’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage now that is the background supply secured along with said demand x200b x200b short squeeze before going into the q3 results which were released on thursday 4th november it is probably worth mentioning why i believe himx is a clear short squeeze candidate to me there is every possibility of this being a gme round – and as a dear friend said given the timing this opportunity can even be called the “ gme x’mas special ” so why do i mention a ‘ short squeeze ’ – well according to data as of 15th october short interest is around 7m shares representing of float with bloomberg noting days to cover however this data is as of october and i believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings q3 earnings were on 4th november meaning currently the short interest is likely against float now lack of stock availability means of “short availability utilization” a big short squeeze is coming this is a “ gme x’mas special ” x200b x200b x200b with earnings now out of the way with good results and much better than expected guidance there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway gives some stats on borrow availability see chart below currently this shows 200k of borrow availability on ibkr – so not a whole lot considering daily volume on average is around million x200b x200b x200b as you can see stock borrow availability is quite low we had similar level of limited availability in jun’when the stock jumped from end of may to high of intraday on 30th june the increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool odd i think we will see this again shortly but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs i understand the short thesis – i really do potential sales decline as end consumer demand on certain products were falling alongside margin pressure as foundries himx suppliers raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices that was a good fair thesis the whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise i can personally find no reason to be short this stock anymore at least for the next months especially given this solid guidance we pretty much have clarity on the next quarters full guidance on q4’and decent outlook for q1’and then we will have a dividend payment in july record date is usually jun from what i hear and mind you this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 7m short position is held by an asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings the short interest has jumped from 7m shares as of 30th june dividend record date to a 7m as of 15th october the share price in turn collapsed from closing price on 30th june to a low of on 15th october but now its time for a reversal x200b x200b the dividend or maybe even a stock buyback himx has historically paid out between of its eps out as dividend for fy20 himx paid out of its ifrs fully diluted eps as a dividend paid in jul’the average payout since fy07 to fy20 has been fair to assume a payout of between of ifrs fully diluted eps continues this year so far ytd q3’the ifrs fully diluted eps is company recently gave q4 guidance of between to assuming the mid point of this guidance we arrive at a potential fully diluted eps for fy21 of share an payout means a dividend of between to share which represents a dividend yield of between given share price of today that dear friends is a crazy cost to short the dividend is usually declared in june and paid in july – so we have some time but let us face it everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon now of course we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend an earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so i would not put a potential stock buyback past the company all in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen over the last few weeks it is quite a surprise that the stock has not rallied much more more on valuation later at the end of the write up x200b x200b a question from the “growth bros” paying a dividend means this business will not grow a common question – and i get it not many dividend paying businesses grow like himx understandable but note that himx and its ddic peers are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light so points worth noting dividend is based off eps which is net of r d expenses which in itself is ‘reinvestment ’ r d is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly reasonably capex light business as himx is fabless it does not involve significant amounts of capex also himx invested significantly in r d and capex between fy17 to fy19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products specifically it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products r d – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range like products for 4k 8k tvs as well as focus on developing new products for non ddic business and capex including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase in other words after a few years of pain fy17 to fy19 which was effectively their ‘investment phase’ himx and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard earned labour today x200b x200b so performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so why has not the share price gone up then well this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend for fy20’s performance as well perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors however this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved the charts below show the change over time x200b x200b x200b hedge funds’ share has increased from of outstanding stock in to today while institutional incl mutual funds ownership has increased from in fy19 to today note that much of this increase came in fy20 and fy21 – when performance improved dramatically much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions the institutional hf participation is only set to increase in my opinion also note that the founder ceo family owns of the company x200b x200b so if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving why has not stock kept pace well firstly the stock has climbed significantly since having jumped from a mere share to share today the high on the stock was on 30th june but the price has since declined despite performance improving although the share price has increased performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers more on valuation at the end the belief amongst longs is manipulation folks believe that this stock is manipulated by market makers mms who are often option sellers on himx retail trade the options much more actively than the stock giving an incentive for the mms to keep the stock price depressed x200b with performance outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions divi stock buyback on our side it is time we take back control x200b x200b q3 earnings now – let us discuss the recent earnings q3’revenue yoy q o q guidance was q o q q3’gross margin vs in q2’and vs in q3’guidance was q3’ebitda 9x yoy or q o q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here q3’levered fcf of 54m bringing ytd fcf to 192m the charts below show quarterly performance more clearly x200b x200b x200b x200b charts for annual performance incl ltm sep’and ytd sep’are shown below x200b x200b x200b x200b so q3 results came at higher end of guidance excellent x200b x200b guidance positively surprising the market performance was going to be decent however it was the q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on why was the market waiting on guidance because indications were that a consumer demand for tv and smartphones were fading b panel makers were feeling the pain i e himx customers were seeing pricing decline c foundries were raising prices i e himx suppliers raising prices worries around cost increase fading demand would mean a mix of topline and margin pressure……or at least that is what the shorts were betting on before i go into himx’s guidance let us just say that market had been following panel makers some himx customers – which had been guiding to lower volumes in q4 its nearest and largest competitor novatek released guidance on thursday 4th nov morning stating that q4’revenue would decline to q o q and q4’gross margin would decline to from the it registered in q3 this novatek guidance was better than the market feared novatek stock rose in taiwan – so here we were waiting for himx to report something similar but himx killed it why it reported q4 revenue would increase by to q o q gross margin would fall to around from reported in q3 q4 ifrs eps on which dividend is based between to ytd is already vs prior year q4’of i e forecast to grow by roughly 3x q4 non ifrs eps adjusted for non recurring items sbc of between to vs prior year q4’of again 1x roughly yes margin is down marginally i e foundries raising prices but no one expected a growth in revenue coming through to be fair the margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as himx is passing price increases through to its customers anyway “it is simple math” the ceo explained on the call he noted that if the original foundry cost was and himx’s selling price was the gross margin would be however if the foundry raised prices by to and himx passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to the margin would then be a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact but as i said earlier no one expected a growth in revenue coming through in other words – earnings were good guidance took the market by surprise this level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from vertical group analyst jon lopez the only analyst with a sell rating on himx with a target on expectation of bad q4 perhaps mr lopez’s question is below x200b x200b x200b the answer to this question was pretty much that a himx has been giving up a lot of lower end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher end hq business for which it gets industry recognition the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between fy17 – fy19 and b himx has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’ management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “ again and again and again ” yes again’s specifically mentioned – and notes that guidance this time is no different in fact if you look at himx’s historical guidance you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last quarters since q1’– and in most cases either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether x200b x200b x200b x200b so yes – as ceo jordan wu notes the company has a history of delivering to if not beating guidance and has shown this “again and again and again” let us just say management is highly credible x200b x200b top line guidance by segment large ddic – to grow by high single digit q o q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although tv sales will drop slightly due to softer end market however himx remains positive on large ddic into given shortage of wafer capacity small mid sized ddic overall – grow low teens q o q and yoy by sub segment within small mid sized ddic smartphones grow high teens q o q yoy tablet flat q o q and automotive grow double digit q o q and yoy stalled capacity is restricting himx’s ability to meet all customer demands so significant shortage still persists interestingly within the smartphone segment himx has mkt share company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features” also and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches” i e winning more market share lots to like here automotive is himx’s highest growth area in which it holds a and growing market share company notes that the “increase in the number size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate all indicating much more ddic demand per vehicle” not going to write all this up but the below extract from q3 earnings tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business within this segment x200b x200b x200b x200b as noted earlier himx also has a non ddic segment which is expected to decline in q4 but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from onwards at higher margins this segment includes components for ar vr iot applications this is more of a longer term area worth watching as adoption increases but in the last quarter himx reported a design win with a top tier name for a mainstream application industrial application from what i gather – which is on track to enter into mass production in q4 results more visible in figures in addition himx also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly covering a broad range of applications including notebook home appliances utility meter automotive battery surveillance camera panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few” some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year meaning should see the benefits of these coming on himx also notes “within just year since himx started sampling company’s wiseeye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low power edge ai devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services ” this opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city smart office healthcare agriculture retail and factory automation himx anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year this segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future x200b valuation conclusion the chart below compares himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from ddic so do not make for direct comps however on each metric on an ltm basis himx screens much cheaper vs peers – with at minimum a upside upside is between when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between share vs today the average fair value on traded comparables for himx shares is – representing an upside of vs the current share price of x200b x200b x200b x200b as for transaction comps south korean ddic business magnachip mx us is currently subject to a takeover offer from chinese private equity wise road capital for share us government is trying to stop this this offer represents 21x ev ebitda – which if applied to himx gives a fv of share upside is share possible here absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor novatek is actually declining this is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end brands we have not even discussed himx’s potential for growth into ar vr even if they are mid to long term plans and nothing imminent in the next year but i would say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game” whether the game be physical digital or even in the metaverse yes this is a metaverse beneficiary – although that is probably some time away for now i rest my case good business excellent valuation with potential for a massive

Wondering if I should set a limit buy for UGAZ at 20ish for tommorow. Expecting initial market drop, but it seems bound to bounce. Just curious of other's opinions. Thanks!   \n",

We investigated our grand pile of loot and we found documents in regards to one of the most infamous events in the history of the United States. The key is that the documents were not public, nor would this company want them public. Not to mention thousands of documents surrounding companies such as Monsanto, Bank of America, and many other Fortune 500...”\\n\\n#Some Documents \\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/1d319c019efc0a2d71e518329481b032-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/ac29bc3f47ce71191b2789f777a23297-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/df753ce9111fcde67dea986403c127eb-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/99b91cd19e7490d7772b01a7ac272ee9-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/ed92d235c94b2b06a10a0a65013c0cb6-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/1edf63b4f4cc9f2c7fbad89625f5757b-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/dedacabd7dea45a8910569677e8135b6-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/48b2689ad6adc168951731207547ef8c-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/8d99746f5b2c7ec6f1b7ed4dbf0074d3-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/43b37e3a09cf880e5895379b060b9d09-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/b5425d0f13fdf1a60a0a8efc992be9fe-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/555fec6a26b6981b460079bd168a33a6-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/6dbe877122e82837bbeee831fc509537-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/92a63f76bb1b31d5c6e032e130b81870-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/89e1cc9055818f153fe928543fe315cd-full.jpg\\n\\nhttps://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/12/28/697109e0c3816ae39d0a0ffdd7c23610-full.jpg\\n\\n\\n“...We're also releasing a small part of the larger archive of the 911 World Trade Center Litigation documents publicly. There's thousands of files included in the archive. Everyone can freely have a copy of the archive and we would encourage it. However, the archive is completely encrypted using a very strong AES encryption and very strong master keys that will prevent anyone from decrypting the veracrypt containers until we publicly release the keys for each layer. The archive is split between five layers. Layer 1 being the most modest, and Layer 5 containing the most heavy hitting and impactful documents, with Layer 2, Layer 3, and Layer 4 containing ever-increasingly scandalous materials. We encourage everyone to obtain a copy of all five archives. As time goes on, we may publicly release keys for each of these containers if our request...”\\n\\n\\n#Key for Layer 1 has been released. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“...It wasn't just Hiscox Syndicates Ltd that was put at risk, it was Lloyds of London as well as others. Another entity unnamed  is Lloyds of London. Hiscox Syndicates Ltd and Lloyds of London are some of the biggest insurers on the planet insuring everything from the smallest policies to some of the largest policies on the planet, and who even insured structures such as the World Trade Centers. At this point, the keen amongst you may finally be drawing conclusions at this point, but you'll still be astonished at what's to come. Keep reading. This also means that Silverstein Properties is involved, doesn't it? Now things are getting more interesting. Most of you readers will not be privy to the processes and methods utilised by Fortune 500s to litigate high-impact cases, but we are, and thankfully for us, we're going to let you in on this process. When major incidents like the WTC 911 incident happen, part of the litigation must involve SSI (Sensitive Security Information) and SCI (Special Compartment Information) from the likes of the FBI, CIA, TSA, FAA, DOD, and others being introduced into evidence, but of course this can't become public, for fear of compromising a nation's security, so they temporarily release these materials to the solicitor firms involved in the litigation with the strict demand they're destroyed after their use and that remain highly protected and confidential to only be used behind closed doors.

I’m very very new to investing. I only just set up a fidelity account. I decided to take out $1000 out of my savings so that I’d have some wiggle room, but still have plenty left in the back. I have a very limited knowledge of stocks, but it’s something I want to get into because I feel like I can make more money with it since I’m not working due to the fact that I’m a full time college student. What are some stocks that aren’t too volatile, but can still make me a decent amount of money?   \n",

       "10665  $HIMX - a potential Short squeeze play. GME X'mas special! **$HIMX represents a very interesting opportunity at present.**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**TLDR:**\\n\\n1. Taiwan-based display driver chip (DDIC) company – trading in US markets. Trades very cheapy at 1.2x sales, 3.3x EBITDA and &lt;5x FCF (all FY21e figures)!\\n\\nThe shares are cheap in a more “normal” S&amp;P multiple environment, let alone the current one where they screen as ***stupid cheap*** with no good reason apart from potential Market Maker (MM) Manipulation\\n\\n2. Direct valuation vs peers shows at least 100-200% upside on traded comparables (FV of between $23-$34/share vs $11.45 today). Potential for up to 375% upside ($54/share) if the MagnaChip acquisition EV/EBITDA multiple becomes a precedent.\\n\\n3. Excellent Q3 earnings + much better than expected guidance for Q4’21 and even Q1’22, offering excellent visibility. Management is very credible and have ***consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters! Mostly at higher end of guidance, if not a beat altogether***\\*.\\*\\n\\n4. On track to pay between $1.97-$2.46 in dividends next year – representing a yield of between 17% - 22% on current stock price of $11.45. Could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback.\\n\\n5. Not only are management very credible but they are also very competent, having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers (even before covid) and having invested in both R&amp;D and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n..and now for the fun bit:\\n\\n6. ***Potential for a significant short squeeze***. Short interest spiked all the way through to Q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook. As of 15 October, there were \\~24.7m shares short, which against a 132m float equates to \\~19% short-against-float. NASDAQ notes 11-days to cover as of 15 October.\\n\\nThe amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings, which was last week on 4th November. This means that it is highly likely that as of today, more than 20% of $HIMX stock is now being shorted. I believe this is now at the limit of shorting. In other words, there is very little available to short – and I have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to 100% - meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a **“*****GME X’mas special*****”.**\\n\\n7. Cant confirm this (***unconfirmed hearsay***) but hearing that much of the short position is held by an ***Asian hedge fund*** which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up….. and it has already shot up \\~15% last couple of weeks.\\n\\nDisclosure: I own stock + Jan’22 and Mar’22 calls. Position screenshot below, for transparency purposes. I have exposure to 36,602 shares (2,402 shares + 342 option contracts across $15 Jan’22 and $10 Mar’22).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfwdymqkrby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31f7c8d5426e1d5f26506469e3c71de44a3054f4\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**What does $HIMX do? Products?**\\n\\nBefore we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here’s a quick snippet of what Himax does:\\n\\n$HIMX is a fabless integrated chip (IC) design house specializing in the field of Display Driver (DDICs). These DDICs are used to make ‘panels’ which are, in turn, used in:\\n\\n\\- ***Large sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; TVs, Notebooks, Monitors, etc\\n\\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid sized DDICs*** \\-&gt; Smartphones, Tablets, Displays in Automotive/Vehicles, etc\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1n5j99qmrby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c541fc1f64fc52149b5559894a07782dbd6a6a36\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn addition to DDICs, $HIMX also has a non-DDIC business which includes the following:\\n\\n\\- ***High end Timing Controller*** which improves power efficiency in displays\\n\\n\\- ***WiseEye ultra power AI*** \\--&gt; an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ***AI and ML*** to analyse collected data, all within the chip itself (rather than relying on transmission to cloud). Usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader Internet of Things (IoT) area.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gf47v2mnrby71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3abeceb85f503e711594507a3d7f1bf876753ad\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\- ***Liquid Cystal on Silicon (LCoS) microdisplays*** – with usage in ***AR/VR glasses***, Automotive Head up Displays (HUD), ***Holographic Displays***, etc.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9wde7norby71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0407a077b19352f7ea1b90f06fd4e15bf6ef670d\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\- ***Other products*** in Wafer Level Optics (WLO) and 3D sensing (facial recognition technology in phones, etc)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnlwalyprby71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0baf9dadae4939dabfa212c9b1001ea47344c1d\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are, and where it is used:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3nuqds2rrby71.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f936ff4beb84e7901c6ae5576e0049b69de487a\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Revenue by segment:**\\n\\nRevenue is split broadly equally amongst Large sized DDIC, Smartphone and Android Tablets divisions (all at roughly 23% each) – with Automotive OEM representing \\~15% of revenue on aa Last Twelve Month (LTM) basis, and Non driver ICs \\~12.5%.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptftqd0srby71.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45abd9d6107b6e79491b8775f81f5a0eacb6a219\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n***However, $HIMX has seen significant growth in Automotive OEMs and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward.***\\n\\nThe Q3 revenue split by segment is shown below.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ougzk8osrby71.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=589115891d1e2aa41d33ab147a5d1ccce7b58ef7\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Competitors and Market Shares:**\\n\\nIn the Q3’21 presentation (available [here](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_FInal.pdf)), $HIMX notes that it is the 4th largest DDIC player globally with 10% market share behind Novatek (24%), Samsung (23%; also a customer) and LX Semicon / SiliconWorks (11%).\\n\\nYou may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here (which have smaller DDIC contributions by revenue) including FocalTech, Synaptics, Sitronix and Mediatek.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b55k1yktrby71.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f7f1a3c4d75e3f529428835e802315127f35c9d\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs for ***market share*** by the individual segments, as of Q3’21, $HIMX’s market shares were:\\n\\n\\- Large DDIC: 10.5%\\n\\n\\- Smartphones: 10.4%\\n\\n\\- ***Tablets: 37.7%*** but note that ***$HIMX has &gt; 60% market share*** of Android / non iOS tablets – the 37.7% quoted here is across all tablets including Apple.\\n\\n\\- ***Automotive OEM: 32.8%***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So, what has been happening recently with Himax?**\\n\\n2020 was an excellent year for $HIMX not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked, but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors.\\n\\nCompany realized quite early on, even before covid, that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products.\\n\\n$HIMX management ***foresaw*** that this historical lack of investment in \"mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes”, would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity. So, over the last few years, $HIMX cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long-term contracts to secure additional supply for itself.\\n\\nWhen covid hit in early 2020 and when all corporates cancelled their product orders, extra foundry capacity came to market initially…. and $HIMX capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves.\\n\\n***Covid was a blessing in disguise for $HIMX*** – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals, but the significant increase in demand for its end-products meant that $HIMX found itself in a very sweet spot.\\n\\nThis gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked. ***When many DDIC providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply (especially the non Taiwanese players),*** [***$HIMX***](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMX&amp;src=cashtag_click) ***walked out in a full jump suit, and that too, a colourful one!!***\\n\\nThis allowed it to ***take a decent amount of market share*** over the course of the last year. The graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the Smartphone and Tablets segments especially in FY20.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qea2duvrby71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afa533ebd26875345eaf4c62fc263b263fd7e147\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So what is this increase in demand that management foresaw?**\\n\\n$HIMX management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products (consumer electronics, broadly speaking) …..but also saw the increasing adoption of HQ screens in new areas like ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** and ***Automotive/vehicles***.\\n\\nIn addition, the ***modernisation and electrification of vehicles (EV)*** would further boost the requirement for screens. At the same time (and slightly unrelated, but worth mentioning now), they also noted that ***this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly***. This resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the Non Driver IC business (which in itself has a lot of growth potential). In other words, the business invested in potential diversification away from just DDICs, into related products.\\n\\nOn top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products + screen adoption in other areas +electrification of vehicles, etc, management also noted that other unrelated applications such ***5G and high performance computing (HPC)*** – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its DDIC business used.\\n\\nIn other words, $HIMX management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for, some time ago.\\n\\n***I guess what this shows is that management here are excellent.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Isn’t adding long-term supply at a time when demand spiked risky? Will demand persist?**\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, $HIMX added market share in 2020 and 2021 – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients.\\n\\nHowever, $HIMX was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i.e. the consumer electronics / automotive OEM brands. In other words, the increase in supply that $HIMX is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand…. and $HIMX is just in between, satisfying that demand.\\n\\n$HIMX has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers, who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from $HIMX for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nSo yes, for now – the demand will persist, and as management has said, ***this demand will persist into much of 2022, given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and $HIMX’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage***\\*.\\*\\n\\nNow, that’s the background\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Supply secured along with said demand.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**SHORT SQUEEZE**\\n\\nBefore going into the Q3 results which were released on Thursday, 4th November, it is probably worth mentioning why I believe $HIMX is a clear ***Short Squeeze*** candidate. To me, there is every possibility of this being a GME round 2.0 – and as a dear friend said, given the timing, this opportunity can even be called the “***GME X’mas special***”.\\n\\nSo, why do I mention a ‘***SHORT SQUEEZE***\\*\\*’\\*\\* – well, according to data as of 15th October, short interest is around 24.7m shares, representing \\~19% of float, with Bloomberg noting \\~11 days to cover.\\n\\nHowever, this data is as of 15 October and I believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings (Q3 earnings were on 4th November) meaning currently the short interest is likely &gt;20% against float now.\\n\\nLack of stock availability means &gt; 99% of “short availability utilization”. A big short squeeze is coming. This is a “***GME X’mas special***”.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0i4pnqwrby71.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c93f3de4dd8eb9c3788bd14993f62d51d2214651\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWith earnings now out of the way, with good results and much-better-than-expected guidance, ***there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway.***\\n\\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/HIMX) gives some stats on borrow availability (see chart below). Currently, this shows 200k of borrow availability (on IBKR) – so not a whole lot, considering daily volume on average is around 2 million.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r689rsjxrby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba222cfe0972ca651243195605b554e26f4d8ba\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs you can see, stock borrow availability is quite low. We had similar level of limited availability in Jun’21 - when the stock jumped from $11 (end of May) to high of &gt;$17 intraday on 30th June.\\n\\nThe increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool 50% odd. ***I think we will see this again shortly, but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs.***\\n\\nI understand the short-thesis – I really do.\\n\\nPotential sales decline (as end consumer demand on certain products were falling) alongside margin pressure as foundries ($HIMX suppliers) raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices. That was a good / fair thesis.\\n\\n***The whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise.***\\n\\nI can personally find ***NO REASON*** to be short this stock anymore at least for the ***next 7 months***, especially given this solid guidance. We pretty much have clarity on the next 2 quarters (full guidance on Q4’21 and decent outlook for Q1’22) and then we will have a ***dividend payment*** in July (record date is usually 30 Jun).\\n\\n***From what I hear, and mind you, this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 24.7m short position is held by an Asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings.***\\n\\nThe short interest has jumped from 12.7m shares as of 30th June (dividend record date) to a 24.7m as of 15th October 2021. The share price in turn collapsed from $16.7 (closing price) on 30th June to a low of $9.79 on 15th October 2021.\\n\\n***But now, its time for a reversal.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The Dividend (or maybe even a stock buyback?)**\\n\\n$HIMX has historically paid out between 50%-120% of its EPS out as dividend. For FY20, $HIMX paid out 100% of its IFRS fully diluted EPS  as a dividend (paid in Jul’21).\\n\\nThe average payout since FY07 to FY20 has been \\~80%. Fair to assume a payout of between 80% - 100% of IFRS fully diluted EPS continues this year.\\n\\nSo far, YTD Q3’21, the IFRS fully diluted EPS is $1.69. Company recently gave Q4 guidance of between $0.745 to $0.795. Assuming the mid-point of this guidance, we arrive at a potential fully diluted EPS for FY21 of $2.46/share.\\n\\nAn 80-100% payout means a dividend of between $1.97 to $2.46/share, which represents a ***dividend yield of between 17-22% given share price of $11.45 today!!***\\n\\n***That, dear friends, is a crazy cost to short.***\\n\\nThe dividend is usually declared in June and paid in July – so we have some time. But let’s face it, everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon.\\n\\nNow, of course, we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend. ***An earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks.***\\n\\nCompany has bought back shares previously – and to be honest, the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so I wouldn’t put a potential stock buyback past the company.\\n\\nAll in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen \\~15% over the last few weeks, it’s quite a surprise that the stock hasn’t rallied much more.\\n\\nMore on valuation later (at the end of the write up).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**A question from the “Growth Bros”: paying a dividend means this business will not grow?**\\n\\nA common question – and I get it. Not many dividend paying businesses grow like $HIMX. Understandable.\\n\\nBut, note that $HIMX (and its DDIC peers) are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light.\\n\\nSo, 2 points worth noting:\\n\\n1. ***Dividend is based off EPS, which is net of R&amp;D expenses -&gt; which in itself is ‘reinvestment***\\*\\*’\\*\\*. R&amp;D is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly.\\n2. ***Reasonably capex-light business***: as $HIMX is fabless, it does not involve significant amounts of capex.\\n\\nAlso, $HIMX invested significantly in R&amp;D and capex between FY17 to FY19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products. Specifically, it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products.\\n\\n\\- ***R&amp;D*** – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range (like products for 4K/8K TVs) as well as focus on developing new products for non DDIC business, and\\n\\n\\- ***Capex*** \\- including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase\\n\\nIn other words, after a few years of pain (FY17 to FY19) which was effectively their ‘investment phase’, $HIMX and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard-earned labour today.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so, why hasn’t the share price gone up then?**\\n\\nWell, this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name.\\n\\nPerformance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend (for FY20’s performance) as well.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors. However, this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved. The charts below show the change over time.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycrah2gzrby71.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22fbdf056d2a59dae4f167ab2af4342d1155f6ea\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHedge Funds’ share has increased from 3.7% of outstanding stock in 2019 to 15.2% today, while institutional (incl mutual funds) ownership has increased from 9.1% in FY19 to 10.2% today. Note that much of this increase came in FY20 and FY21 – when performance improved dramatically.\\n\\nMuch of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions. ***The institutional + HF participation is only set to increase in my opinion.***\\n\\nAlso note that the founder/CEO (+ family) owns 24% of the company.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**So, if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving, why hasn’t stock kept pace?**\\n\\nWell, firstly the stock has climbed significantly since 2019, having jumped from a mere $2.8/share to $11.45/share today. The high on the stock was $16.66 on 30th June 2021 but the price has since declined, despite performance improving.\\n\\nAlthough the share price has increased, performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers. ***More on valuation at the end***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\n\\n***The belief amongst longs is MANIPULATION!*** Folks believe that this stock is ***manipulated by Market Makers (MMs)*** who are often option sellers on $HIMX\\*\\*.\\*\\* ***Retail trade the options much more actively than the stock, giving an incentive for the MMs to keep the stock price depressed***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**With performance, outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions (divi + stock buyback) on our side, it’s time we TAKE BACK CONTROL!!**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Q3 Earnings**\\n\\nNow – let’s discuss the recent earnings\\n\\n***Q3’21 revenue***: +75.4% yoy / +15.2% q-o-q (guidance was 12-18% q-o-q)\\n\\n***Q3’21 gross margin***: 51.5% vs 47.5% in Q2’21 and vs 22.3% in Q3’20 (guidance was 50.5-52%)\\n\\n**Q3’21 EBITDA**: +9x yoy or +23% q-o-q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here!\\n\\n***Q3’21 Levered FCF*** of $54m, bringing YTD FCF to $192m.\\n\\nThe charts below show quarterly performance more clearly.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iafp0w21sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f09a541b8919354aeb49d2d8d134fa89caa4b170\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCharts for annual performance incl LTM Sep’21 and YTD Sep’21 are shown below:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahwxlw42sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c6a50f51cc7ed5113acb1e1646a677bc13d6d5e\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n***So Q3 results came at higher end of guidance. Excellent.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**GUIDANCE: (positively) surprising the market**\\n\\nPerformance was going to be decent. However, it was the Q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on, and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on.\\n\\n***Why was the market waiting on guidance?*** Because indications were that:\\n\\n(a) consumer demand for TV and smartphones were fading,\\n\\n(b) panel makers were feeling the pain (i.e. $HIMX customers were seeing pricing decline)\\n\\n(c) foundries were raising prices (i.e. $HIMX suppliers raising prices)\\n\\nWorries around cost increase + fading demand would mean a mix of topline AND margin pressure……or at least that’s what the shorts were betting on.\\n\\nBefore I go into $HIMX’s guidance, let’s just say that market had been following panel makers (some $HIMX customers) – which had been guiding to lower volumes in Q4\\n\\n\\+\\n\\nits nearest and largest competitor, Novatek released guidance on Thursday (4th Nov 2021) morning stating that:\\n\\n\\- Q4’21 revenue would decline -3.5% to -6% q-o-q, and\\n\\n\\- Q4’21 gross margin would decline to 48-50% from the 52% it registered in Q3.\\n\\nThis Novatek guidance was better than the market feared (Novatek stock rose +10% in Taiwan) – so here we were waiting for $HIMX to report something similar.\\n\\n***But $HIMX KILLED IT. Why? It reported:***\\n\\n\\- ***Q4 revenue*** would ***INCREASE*** by +4% to +8% q-o-q,\\n\\n\\- ***Gross margin***: would fall to around 50% (from 51.7% reported in Q3)\\n\\n\\- ***Q4 IFRS EPS*** (on which dividend is based): between $0.745 to $0.795 (YTD is already $1.69) vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.195 i.e. forecast to grow by roughly 3x!\\n\\n\\- ***Q4 non IFRS EPS*** (adjusted for non-recurring items + SBC) of between $0.78 to $0.83 vs prior year (Q4’20) of $0.197 (again 3.1x roughly)\\n\\nYes, margin is down marginally (i.e foundries raising prices) ***but no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through!***\\n\\nTo be fair, the ***margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect*** than a cost increase impact as $HIMX is passing price increases through to  its customers anyway.\\n\\n“It’s simple math”, the CEO explained on the call. He noted that if the original foundry cost was $1 and $HIMX’s selling price was $2 -&gt; the gross margin would be 50%.\\n\\nHowever, if the foundry raised prices by $0.10 to $1.10 and $HIMX passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to $2.1, the margin would then be 47.6% -&gt; ***a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact***\\*.\\*\\n\\n***But, as I said earlier, no-one expected a growth in revenue coming through.*** In other words – earnings were good + guidance took the market by surprise.\\n\\nThis level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from Vertical Group analyst, Jon Lopez (the only analyst with a SELL rating on $HIMX with a $7.5 target, on expectation of bad Q4 perhaps?)\\n\\nMr. Lopez’s question is below:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bet6o463sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ae1b659f263b95c39d8baa62943b9e8d944ce87\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe answer to this question was pretty much that\\n\\na) $HIMX has been giving up a lot of lower-end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher-end / HQ business for which it gets industry recognition (*the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between FY17 – FY19*), and\\n\\nb) $HIMX has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’.\\n\\nManagement also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “***again and again and again***” (yes, 3 again’s specifically mentioned) – and notes that guidance this time is no different.\\n\\nIn fact, if you look at $HIMX’s historical guidance, you will see that the company has ***consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last 19 quarters (since Q1’17) – and in most cases, either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohq8i754sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d248a679dccc3f7cdcc8652297c727bd8356c78\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo yes – as CEO Jordan Wu notes the company has a history of delivering to (if not beating) guidance and has shown this “again and again and again”!!! Let’s just say ***management is highly credible.***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Top line guidance by segment:**\\n\\n\\- ***Large DDIC*** – to ***GROW*** by ***high single digit q-o-q*** helped by growth of notebook and monitor although TV sales will drop slightly due to softer end market. However, $HIMX remains positive on large DDIC into 2022 given shortage of wafer capacity.\\n\\n\\- ***Small &amp; Mid-sized DDIC*** (overall) – ***GROW*** ***low teens q-o-q*** and ***&gt;50% yoy***\\n\\nBy sub-segment within small &amp; mid-sized DDIC:\\n\\n\\- ***Smartphones*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***high teens q-o-q*** &amp; ***&gt;30% yoy***\\n\\n\\- ***Tablet*** \\-&gt; flat q-o-q, and\\n\\n\\- ***Automotive*** \\-&gt; ***GROW*** ***double-digit q-o-q*** and ***&gt;100% yoy***. Stalled capacity is restricting $HIMX’s ability to meet all customer demands, so significant shortage still persists.\\n\\nInterestingly within the ***Smartphone*** segment ($HIMX has 10.4% mkt share), company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate, ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features”.\\n\\nAlso, and more importantly ***“successful engagements with some key customers*** have been achieved in Q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches”. i.e. ***winning more market share.***\\n\\n***Lots to like here.***\\n\\n***Automotive*** is $HIMX’s highest growth area in which it holds a 32.8% (and growing) market share.\\n\\nCompany notes that the “increase in the number, size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate, all indicating much more DDIC demand per vehicle”.\\n\\nNot going to write all this up but the below extract (from Q3 earnings) tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business, within this segment.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fafsthl5sby71.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1b593a646120e9a85282d0a7bf396dc938b5b23\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs noted earlier, $HIMX also has a ***non-DDIC segment***\\*,\\* which is expected to decline in Q4, but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from 2022 onwards (at higher margins). This segment includes components for ***AR/VR &amp; IoT applications.***\\n\\nThis is more of a longer-term area worth watching as adoption increases, but in the last quarter, $HIMX reported a ***design win with a top-tier name for a mainstream application*** (industrial application, from what I gather) – which is ***on track to enter into mass production in Q4 (results more visible in 2022 figures)****.*\\n\\nIn addition, $HIMX also notes that the ***number of awarded projects*** in this segment is ***growing rapidly***, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few”. ***Some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year, meaning 2022 should see the benefits of these coming on.***\\n\\n$HIMX also notes “within just 1 year since $HIMX started sampling, company’s WiseEye solution has also drawn much attention from ***cloud service providers*** who look for ***secure and low-power edge AI devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services***”. This opens up new market frontiers in areas like ***smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.***\\n\\n$HIMX anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year.\\n\\n***This segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future***\\*.\\*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**VALUATION &amp; Conclusion**\\n\\nThe chart below compares Himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from DDIC so do not make for direct comps.\\n\\nHowever, on each metric, on an LTM basis, $HIMX screens much cheaper vs peers – with, at minimum, a 100% upside! Upside is between 100%-200% when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between $23 - $34/share vs $11.45 today.\\n\\nThe ***average fair value*** on traded comparables for $HIMX shares is $26.7 – representing an upside of 133% vs the current share price of $11.45.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgpjwx26sby71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3143bcb1893e5c70decac03bad63633475a57b1b\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs for ***transaction comps***, South Korean DDIC business, Magnachip ($MX US) is currently subject to a takeover offer from Chinese private equity, Wise Road Capital, for $29/share (US government is trying to stop this). This offer represents ***21x EV/EBITDA*** – which if applied to $HIMX, gives a ***FV of $54/share + 370% upside***\\*!\\*\\n\\n***Is $54/share possible here?*** Absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor (Novatek) is actually declining. This is a business that has invested in its future by being a ***few steps ahead of competition*** with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end-brands.\\n\\nWe haven’t even discussed $HIMX’s potential for growth into AR / VR even if they are mid to long-term plans and nothing imminent (in the next year).\\n\\n***But I’d say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game”, whether the game be physical, digital or even in the METAVERSE.***\\n\\n***Yes, this is a Metaverse beneficiary*** – although, that is probably some time away.\\n\\nFor now, I rest my case. Good business, excellent valuation with potential for a massive short squeeze.\\n\\n**Let’s squeeze this one dry.

                                           how should i invest i am very very new to investing i only just set up a fidelity account i decided to take out out of my savings so that i would have some wiggle room but still have plenty left in the back i have a very limited knowledge of stocks but it is something i want to get into because i feel like i can make more money with it since i am not working due to the fact that i am a full time college student what are some stocks that are not too volatile but can still make me a decent amount of money  \n",

       "10665  himx a potential short squeeze play gme x mas special himx represents a very interesting opportunity at present x200b tldr taiwan based display driver chip ddic company – trading in us markets trades very cheapy at 2x sales 3x ebitda and 5x fcf all fy21e figures the shares are cheap in a more “normal” s p multiple environment let alone the current one where they screen as stupid cheap with no good reason apart from potential market maker mm manipulation direct valuation vs peers shows at least upside on traded comparables fv of between share vs today potential for up to upside share if the magnachip acquisition ev ebitda multiple becomes a precedent excellent q3 earnings much better than expected guidance for q4’and even q1’offering excellent visibility management is very credible and have consistently delivered results “to guidance” for at least the last quarters mostly at higher end of guidance if not a beat altogether on track to pay between in dividends next year – representing a yield of between on current stock price of could also be partly distributed through a stock buyback not only are management very credible but they are also very competent having anticipated the demand surge well in advance of peers even before covid and having invested in both r d and capex and secured additional foundry capacity at a time when others were investing less x200b and now for the fun bit potential for a significant short squeeze short interest spiked all the way through to q3 earnings on expectation of bad outlook as of october there were 7m shares short which against a 132m float equates to short against float nasdaq notes days to cover as of october the amount of stock shorted will only have increased going into earnings which was last week on 4th november this means that it is highly likely that as of today more than of himx stock is now being shorted i believe this is now at the limit of shorting in other words there is very little available to short – and i have found data from a provider which shows the short utilization is close to meaning there is a clear inability to short this stock anymore a big short squeeze is coming this is a “ gme x’mas special ” cannot confirm this unconfirmed hearsay but hearing that much of the short position is held by an asian hedge fund which could get squeezed nicely if stock starts shooting up… and it has already shot up last couple of weeks disclosure i own stock jan’and mar’calls position screenshot below for transparency purposes i have exposure to shares shares option contracts across jan’and mar’x200b x200b x200b what does himx do products before we go into the recent earnings and the opportunity in question – here is a quick snippet of what himax does himx is a fabless integrated chip ic design house specializing in the field of display driver ddics these ddics are used to make ‘panels’ which are in turn used in large sized ddics tvs notebooks monitors etc small mid sized ddics smartphones tablets displays in automotive vehicles etc x200b x200b x200b in addition to ddics himx also has a non ddic business which includes the following high end timing controller which improves power efficiency in displays wiseeye ultra power ai an ultralow power sensor which has the added ability to employ ai and ml to analyse collected data all within the chip itself rather than relying on transmission to cloud usage across a variety of devices especially within the broader internet of things iot area x200b x200b x200b liquid cystal on silicon lcos microdisplays – with usage in ar vr glasses automotive head up displays hud holographic displays etc x200b x200b x200b other products in wafer level optics wlo and 3d sensing facial recognition technology in phones etc x200b x200b x200b as a summary – the below picture gives you an idea of what the products are and where it is used x200b x200b x200b revenue by segment revenue is split broadly equally amongst large sized ddic smartphone and android tablets divisions all at roughly each – with automotive oem representing of revenue on aa last twelve month ltm basis and non driver ics x200b x200b x200b x200b however himx has seen significant growth in automotive oems and expects this segment to represent the largest segment going forward the q3 revenue split by segment is shown below x200b x200b x200b x200b competitors and market shares in the q3’presentation available here himx notes that it is the 4th largest ddic player globally with market share behind novatek samsung also a customer and lx semicon siliconworks you may also be familiar with some of the other listed businesses here which have smaller ddic contributions by revenue including focaltech synaptics sitronix and mediatek x200b x200b x200b x200b as for market share by the individual segments as of q3’himx’s market shares were large ddic smartphones tablets but note that himx has market share of android non ios tablets – the quoted here is across all tablets including apple automotive oem x200b so what has been happening recently with himax was an excellent year for himx not only because the demand for consumer electronics spiked but also because company anticipated a significant shortage in foundry capacity impacting semiconductors company realized quite early on even before covid that there was a significant foundry capacity shortage especially on the specific “mature nodes” for its products himx management foresaw that this historical lack of investment in mature nodes” combined with the increasing demand for both its products as well as new products which use exactly the same “mature nodes” would result in a significant shortage of foundry capacity so over the last few years himx cosied up to its foundry partners and entered into long term contracts to secure additional supply for itself when covid hit in early and when all corporates cancelled their product orders extra foundry capacity came to market initially… and himx capitalized on the opportunity to secure even more foundry supply for themselves covid was a blessing in disguise for himx – not only were they able to secure supplies and enter into much better deals but the significant increase in demand for its end products meant that himx found itself in a very sweet spot this gamble paid off very very well – as demand spiked when many ddic providers were caught with their pants down due to lack of sufficient foundry supply especially the non taiwanese players himx walked out in a full jump suit and that too a colourful one this allowed it to take a decent amount of market share over the course of the last year the graph below shows the significant jump in market shares in the smartphone and tablets segments especially in fy20 x200b x200b x200b x200b so what is this increase in demand that management foresaw himx management expected to see demand increasing for higher end versions of its existing products consumer electronics broadly speaking … but also saw the increasing adoption of hq screens in new areas like internet of things iot and automotive vehicles in addition the modernisation and electrification of vehicles ev would further boost the requirement for screens at the same time and slightly unrelated but worth mentioning now they also noted that this increase in adoption would also require chips which can reduce power consumption significantly this resulted in the business working on options to come with related products which now form part of the non driver ic business which in itself has a lot of growth potential in other words the business invested in potential diversification away from just ddics into related products on top of the increasing demand for higher end existing products screen adoption in other areas electrification of vehicles etc management also noted that other unrelated applications such 5g and high performance computing hpc – would also require components that use the same “mature nodes” that its ddic business used in other words himx management foresaw that increasing demand would come up against a supply shortage – which they started preparing for some time ago i guess what this shows is that management here are excellent x200b x200b is not adding long term supply at a time when demand spiked risky will demand persist as mentioned earlier himx added market share in and – this is from a combination of more volume from both existing clients as well as adding new clients however himx was smart – it entered into deals with both its panel maker customers as well as with leading end customers i e the consumer electronics automotive oem brands in other words the increase in supply that himx is taking on has been matched to the increase in demand… and himx is just in between satisfying that demand himx has taken prepayments and deposits from these customers who wanted to secure their own supply of components for their products from himx for the foreseeable future so yes for now – the demand will persist and as management has said this demand will persist into much of given the clear capacity shortage still being experienced by the industry and himx’s inability to fulfil orders due to this capacity shortage now that is the background supply secured along with said demand x200b x200b short squeeze before going into the q3 results which were released on thursday 4th november it is probably worth mentioning why i believe himx is a clear short squeeze candidate to me there is every possibility of this being a gme round – and as a dear friend said given the timing this opportunity can even be called the “ gme x’mas special ” so why do i mention a ‘ short squeeze ’ – well according to data as of 15th october short interest is around 7m shares representing of float with bloomberg noting days to cover however this data is as of october and i believe the short interest will only have increased going into earnings q3 earnings were on 4th november meaning currently the short interest is likely against float now lack of stock availability means of “short availability utilization” a big short squeeze is coming this is a “ gme x’mas special ” x200b x200b x200b with earnings now out of the way with good results and much better than expected guidance there is literally no good reason for anyone to short this stock in the near term let alone the fact that there is very little availability to short anyway gives some stats on borrow availability see chart below currently this shows 200k of borrow availability on ibkr – so not a whole lot considering daily volume on average is around million x200b x200b x200b as you can see stock borrow availability is quite low we had similar level of limited availability in jun’when the stock jumped from end of may to high of intraday on 30th june the increase in stock price squeezed the shorts so significantly that we saw the stock rally a cool odd i think we will see this again shortly but with the uncertainty now removed – this could rally much much higher than previous highs i understand the short thesis – i really do potential sales decline as end consumer demand on certain products were falling alongside margin pressure as foundries himx suppliers raise prices – could have created a perfect doomsday scenario putting a huge pressure on stock prices that was a good fair thesis the whole short thesis was predicated on a potential reversal in performance – but recent guidance seems to suggest otherwise i can personally find no reason to be short this stock anymore at least for the next months especially given this solid guidance we pretty much have clarity on the next quarters full guidance on q4’and decent outlook for q1’and then we will have a dividend payment in july record date is usually jun from what i hear and mind you this is unconfirmed hearsay – much of this 7m short position is held by an asian hedge fund which had been increasing its short position ahead of the earnings the short interest has jumped from 7m shares as of 30th june dividend record date to a 7m as of 15th october the share price in turn collapsed from closing price on 30th june to a low of on 15th october but now its time for a reversal x200b x200b the dividend or maybe even a stock buyback himx has historically paid out between of its eps out as dividend for fy20 himx paid out of its ifrs fully diluted eps as a dividend paid in jul’the average payout since fy07 to fy20 has been fair to assume a payout of between of ifrs fully diluted eps continues this year so far ytd q3’the ifrs fully diluted eps is company recently gave q4 guidance of between to assuming the mid point of this guidance we arrive at a potential fully diluted eps for fy21 of share an payout means a dividend of between to share which represents a dividend yield of between given share price of today that dear friends is a crazy cost to short the dividend is usually declared in june and paid in july – so we have some time but let us face it everyone can do that math – and not long before institutions jump on this band wagon now of course we are assuming here that the funds will be distributed through a dividend an earlier distribution is also likely – potentially through share buybacks company has bought back shares previously – and to be honest the shares look ridiculously cheap now given its performance – so i would not put a potential stock buyback past the company all in all – there will be significant upward pressure on the price – and although the shares have already risen over the last few weeks it is quite a surprise that the stock has not rallied much more more on valuation later at the end of the write up x200b x200b a question from the “growth bros” paying a dividend means this business will not grow a common question – and i get it not many dividend paying businesses grow like himx understandable but note that himx and its ddic peers are fabless design houses – meaning it is capex light so points worth noting dividend is based off eps which is net of r d expenses which in itself is ‘reinvestment ’ r d is spent on new product innovation or upgrades mostly reasonably capex light business as himx is fabless it does not involve significant amounts of capex also himx invested significantly in r d and capex between fy17 to fy19 given its expectation of a potential surge in demand for its products specifically it focussed on developing new product lines and upgrading existing products r d – including spend to upgrade existing product lines and move towards higher quality product range like products for 4k 8k tvs as well as focus on developing new products for non ddic business and capex including payments to secure additional foundry capacity as well as expansion of existing production capabilities for some existing products including a land purchase in other words after a few years of pain fy17 to fy19 which was effectively their ‘investment phase’ himx and its shareholders are now enjoying the fruits of its hard earned labour today x200b x200b so performance is great and there is a massive shareholder distribution coming – so why has not the share price gone up then well this is the question that still haunts the longs in this name performance and valuation are on our side and the company just reinstated dividend for fy20’s performance as well perhaps the answer is that the stock has been predominantly owned and traded by retail investors however this is changing as more and more hedge funds and institutions are getting involved the charts below show the change over time x200b x200b x200b hedge funds’ share has increased from of outstanding stock in to today while institutional incl mutual funds ownership has increased from in fy19 to today note that much of this increase came in fy20 and fy21 – when performance improved dramatically much of this can be attributed to the company actively marketing itself through attending conferences and pitching to institutions the institutional hf participation is only set to increase in my opinion also note that the founder ceo family owns of the company x200b x200b so if performance is getting better and institutional ownership is improving why has not stock kept pace well firstly the stock has climbed significantly since having jumped from a mere share to share today the high on the stock was on 30th june but the price has since declined despite performance improving although the share price has increased performance has been much better and valuation today is still significantly cheaper vs peers more on valuation at the end the belief amongst longs is manipulation folks believe that this stock is manipulated by market makers mms who are often option sellers on himx retail trade the options much more actively than the stock giving an incentive for the mms to keep the stock price depressed x200b with performance outlook as well as potential stockholder distributions divi stock buyback on our side it is time we take back control x200b x200b q3 earnings now – let us discuss the recent earnings q3’revenue yoy q o q guidance was q o q q3’gross margin vs in q2’and vs in q3’guidance was q3’ebitda 9x yoy or q o q – the impact of operating leverage is clearly visible here q3’levered fcf of 54m bringing ytd fcf to 192m the charts below show quarterly performance more clearly x200b x200b x200b x200b charts for annual performance incl ltm sep’and ytd sep’are shown below x200b x200b x200b x200b so q3 results came at higher end of guidance excellent x200b x200b guidance positively surprising the market performance was going to be decent however it was the q4 guidance that market was eagerly waiting on and which the shorts were keeping a close eye on why was the market waiting on guidance because indications were that a consumer demand for tv and smartphones were fading b panel makers were feeling the pain i e himx customers were seeing pricing decline c foundries were raising prices i e himx suppliers raising prices worries around cost increase fading demand would mean a mix of topline and margin pressure……or at least that is what the shorts were betting on before i go into himx’s guidance let us just say that market had been following panel makers some himx customers – which had been guiding to lower volumes in q4 its nearest and largest competitor novatek released guidance on thursday 4th nov morning stating that q4’revenue would decline to q o q and q4’gross margin would decline to from the it registered in q3 this novatek guidance was better than the market feared novatek stock rose in taiwan – so here we were waiting for himx to report something similar but himx killed it why it reported q4 revenue would increase by to q o q gross margin would fall to around from reported in q3 q4 ifrs eps on which dividend is based between to ytd is already vs prior year q4’of i e forecast to grow by roughly 3x q4 non ifrs eps adjusted for non recurring items sbc of between to vs prior year q4’of again 1x roughly yes margin is down marginally i e foundries raising prices but no one expected a growth in revenue coming through to be fair the margin increase is more of a dilutionary effect than a cost increase impact as himx is passing price increases through to its customers anyway “it is simple math” the ceo explained on the call he noted that if the original foundry cost was and himx’s selling price was the gross margin would be however if the foundry raised prices by to and himx passed this through to its customers and selling price increased to the margin would then be a dilutionary impact rather than a pure profitability impact but as i said earlier no one expected a growth in revenue coming through in other words – earnings were good guidance took the market by surprise this level of “surprise” is best encapsulated by the question from vertical group analyst jon lopez the only analyst with a sell rating on himx with a target on expectation of bad q4 perhaps mr lopez’s question is below x200b x200b x200b the answer to this question was pretty much that a himx has been giving up a lot of lower end business where price competition is rampant in return for higher end hq business for which it gets industry recognition the company had been aggressively investing in this product suite upgrade between fy17 – fy19 and b himx has been building relationships with top tier brands directly rather than going only through panel makers – making the demand for its products more ‘defensive’ management also alluded to them having proven their sales performance vs guidance “ again and again and again ” yes again’s specifically mentioned – and notes that guidance this time is no different in fact if you look at himx’s historical guidance you will see that the company has consistently delivered earnings “within guidance” for at least the last quarters since q1’– and in most cases either at the higher end of guidance or a beat altogether x200b x200b x200b x200b so yes – as ceo jordan wu notes the company has a history of delivering to if not beating guidance and has shown this “again and again and again” let us just say management is highly credible x200b x200b top line guidance by segment large ddic – to grow by high single digit q o q helped by growth of notebook and monitor although tv sales will drop slightly due to softer end market however himx remains positive on large ddic into given shortage of wafer capacity small mid sized ddic overall – grow low teens q o q and yoy by sub segment within small mid sized ddic smartphones grow high teens q o q yoy tablet flat q o q and automotive grow double digit q o q and yoy stalled capacity is restricting himx’s ability to meet all customer demands so significant shortage still persists interestingly within the smartphone segment himx has mkt share company notes that it is “undertaking new design developments supporting higher frame rate ultra slim bezel and higher resolution features” also and more importantly “successful engagements with some key customers have been achieved in q4 with more customers indicating their interest for their next launches” i e winning more market share lots to like here automotive is himx’s highest growth area in which it holds a and growing market share company notes that the “increase in the number size and sophistication of displays inside the vehicle is evolving at a rapid rate all indicating much more ddic demand per vehicle” not going to write all this up but the below extract from q3 earnings tells you everything you need to know and shows just how positive the future is for this business within this segment x200b x200b x200b x200b as noted earlier himx also has a non ddic segment which is expected to decline in q4 but is expected to be a significant growth contributor from onwards at higher margins this segment includes components for ar vr iot applications this is more of a longer term area worth watching as adoption increases but in the last quarter himx reported a design win with a top tier name for a mainstream application industrial application from what i gather – which is on track to enter into mass production in q4 results more visible in figures in addition himx also notes that the number of awarded projects in this segment is growing rapidly covering a broad range of applications including notebook home appliances utility meter automotive battery surveillance camera panoramic video conferencing and medical…”to name a few” some applications already slated for mass production at end of this year meaning should see the benefits of these coming on himx also notes “within just year since himx started sampling company’s wiseeye solution has also drawn much attention from cloud service providers who look for secure and low power edge ai devices to help collect big data for their cloud based services ” this opens up new market frontiers in areas like smart city smart office healthcare agriculture retail and factory automation himx anticipates more design wins awards and growing volume shipments starting next year this segment will drive a lot of growth in this business in the future x200b valuation conclusion the chart below compares himax’s valuation vs peers – note that some of these competitors have other divisions apart from ddic so do not make for direct comps however on each metric on an ltm basis himx screens much cheaper vs peers – with at minimum a upside upside is between when using traded comparables – representing fair value of between share vs today the average fair value on traded comparables for himx shares is – representing an upside of vs the current share price of x200b x200b x200b x200b as for transaction comps south korean ddic business magnachip mx us is currently subject to a takeover offer from chinese private equity wise road capital for share us government is trying to stop this this offer represents 21x ev ebitda – which if applied to himx gives a fv of share upside is share possible here absolutely – as this is a business that is now growing when its nearest competitor novatek is actually declining this is a business that has invested in its future by being a few steps ahead of competition with respect to developing new products as well as upgrading its existing product suite and building a direct relationship with the end brands we have not even discussed himx’s potential for growth into ar vr even if they are mid to long term plans and nothing imminent in the next year but i would say that a foot in the door already means they will remain relevant and “in the game” whether the game be physical
